# Hi, I'm Diamond :see_no_evil:

Thanks for checking out my GitHub! I am a software developer based in sunny San Diego, California. As of late, I have been doing backend development using JVM languages, although I do have full-stack experience. I am working on my front-end skills again in my free time.  Hopefully, I'll have more to share with you soon.
